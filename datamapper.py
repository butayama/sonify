''' datamapper contains the three parts of the Data Mapper functionality:
    1) DataObjectCollection, DataObject, and TimeSeries represent the data to be used
        as the basis for the representation.
    2) DataRenderer is able to render a DataObjectCollection into a musical (or other)
        representation
    3) A map defines the mapping from DataObjectCollection to DataRenderer. It
        maps a key in the data eg ('temperature') to an attribute of the musical
        representation (eg 'pitch'), with an understanding of the relative domains and
        ranges of each.
